If doing what is righteous necessarily requires limiting individual freedom, righteousness has been mistaken for evil. People must be free to voluntarily act and inheret the responsibility for the actions they own. A single spider doesn't weave enough web to catch every fly living amoungst it and can't be responsible for another spiders indifference or inabiity to catch more flys than is possible from its own capacity to spin webs. Without ownership there is no incentive structure for morraly consistent ethical values. If a spider attempts to feast on the pray of another spider the greater of the two will naturally have twice the feast.
